              <p>
                I joined the Librum project in July of 2023, and migrated the
                old website from Create React App to Next.js and Chakra UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked with a designed and was given a Figma layout to
                implement. Over the course of several months, the migration was
                completed and I added a host of additional features to the
                website.
              </p>
              <div class="tech-stack">
                <div
                  class="stack-badge dropdown-button"
                  id="readmore"
                  id="arrow1"
                  data-target="card1"
                >
                  <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i>

                <div class="read-more" id="card1">
                  <div>
                    <h4>Process</h4>
                    <p>
                      Upon joining the project, we began the migration and the
                      re-design by first migrating the existing design to
                      Next.js from Create React app. We also chose to use Chakra
                      UI as our component library in an effort to keep the
                      styling across the website consistent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once the code migration was completed, we focused on
                      implementing the new design, which was provided by a
                      designer by way of a Figma layout. When we had the design
                      in a place we were happy with, we then started to bring in
                      additional features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Librum app has a dedicated backend that it uses for
                      user management, book storage, and other backend services.
                      I integrated this API into the website, and built a user
                      management system with a profile page that allows each
                      user to set and update things like email, avatar,
                      password, and view their current storage usage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also configured a content management system (Sanity CMS)
                      to allow the project owner to post blog updates as the app
                      is progressing.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>
                      This project was my biggest undertaking at the time, and I
                      faced a lot of problems that I had to work through and
                      solve. I had to work with an external API to manage the
                      user profile page, user registration, user authentication,
                      as well as site features such as contact forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another hurdle that took a lot of time to overcome was the
                      integration of the Sanity CMS. The Sanity documentation
                      left a lot to be desired, and it required many custom
                      solutions to seemingly easy problems. For instance, I had
                      to create a custom preview mechanism for the blog posts,
                      as well as custom components in order to display images
                      and videos within blog posts. Similarly, displaying block
                      content in a blog post (i.e. paragraph and heading tags,
                      font sizes, etc) also required a custom solution that
                      Sanity did not provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another major challenge is the fact that this website
                      currently supports just under one thousand monthly active
                      users, and while we have several developers assisting with
                      various tasks, I am the main contributor with over 40k
                      lines of code committed to the repo. This means that,
                      often times, I am the only one working on bugs and other
                      problems reported by our users.
                    </p>

                A very simple PHP application built as part of the PHP module at
                iO Academy. The app uses a MariaDB backend to store and display
                various plants, with corresponding information such as plant
                image, date planted, projected harvest date, and an estimate of
                time remaining until harvest.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also includes the functionality to add more plants, as well
                remove existing plants (which are archived in the databases, and
                not permanently deleted), and a dynamic search function which
                returns search results as the user is typing.

                    <h4>Process</h4>
                    <p>
                      Given that this is a very simple application, the process
                      was not very involved. I came up with a basic wireframe of
                      what I wanted the layout to look like, followed by a
                      database schema.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once the wireframe and the schema were completed and
                      approved by the instructor, I created and seeded the
                      database that the app relies on. Following that, I broke
                      the project up into four stories:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Story 1: Display items from database</li>
                      <li>Story 2: Allow user to add an item</li>
                      <li>Story 3: Allow user to delete an existing item</li>
                      <li>Story 4: Allow user to search their collection</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Once the stories were planned, I broke each story up into
                      manageable tasks, which is how the remainder of
                      development went. Each task was peer reviwed, after whcih
                      it was merged into the story branch. Once all tasks were
                      completed, I made a PR for the story branch into main,
                      which was trainer reviewed and merged after that.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>
                      The main challenge with this project was the fact that we
                      used PHP, which I had virtually no experience with. I had
                      to wrap my mind around a new programming language, as well
                      as object oriented programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      An additional challenge was having to write raw SQL
                      queries for all the database operations. Thus far, I've
                      only used ORMs, so it was quite nice to actually learn
                      what goes on under the hood with database operations.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Tech stack</h4>
                    <p>
                      The backend was written in PHP, using PDO for all database
                      operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The frontend is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle any
                      interactivity and fetching data from the backend.
